Well, welcome.
You've probably thinking youve stumbled  unto another software developer profile"

You're right ðŸ«µ 

but its much more than that you see, as a developer I'm :

A problem solver and critical thinker first. 

"Problem solving" is one of the core reasons software development was conceived, its one big problem solving tool and i have found a rhythm to master and utilize this tool and it features for its intended purposes. I utilize a highly efficient web programming language and its libraries/frameworks to logically develop web applications that are responsive and interactive with the user.

Im also:
- Actively learning.
- I've got an impressive collaborative skills and works well with others as a team.
